# Natasha Kubiak
# Homework 8
#-- Write a program that generates randomly one hundred 3-digit integer numbers
#-- and stores them in 10 lists according to their least significant digit, 
#-- while keeping track of the order in which they were stored.  
#-- Then select randomly one of the 100 numbers you generated, call it i, 
#-- and check the number N(i) of  integers that were inserted in i's list AFTER i.
#-- Repeat the experiment above 100 times and get Ã‘ = 1/100 Sum_i N(i).
