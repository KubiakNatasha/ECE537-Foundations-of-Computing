Question 6.4-5: All values are distinct, The BEST CASE of Heapsort is OMEGA(nlgn). Why>


HeapSort-> Applies..
            Build Max-Heap 
                - Best Case = (O)(n)
            Max-Heapify
                - Best Case = (O)(lgn) or (O)(height)
            HeapSort

Omega(nlgn) is the lower bound of the BEST case. The BESTCASE of Build-Max-Heap AND Heapify for HEAPSORT
would be (O)(nlgn)

Since is is only as good as (O)(nlgn) then it cannot surpass the lower bound of Omega(nlgn)
